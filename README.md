> A website designed for a school project

# Credits
@Niseyami - All of the backend, most of the front end  
@TrailerGirl19 - Did some writing  
@Birdie-Sama - Did the layouting for contact page  
@nahnah13047 - Did the survey

I forgot where most of the images came from, although most are near the top of google images search results.  
The logo used for the fictitious organisation is the Nuxt logo.   
Bootstrap (and as a result popper.js and jquery), Fontawesome and anime.js used to create parts of the site.   
Vue.js and Nuxt.js were used for generating the site.

## Project Setup stuff

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000 (Sometimes is not in line with production version)
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project (like for gh-pages deployment)
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
